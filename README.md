# Adaptive Functions for Enhanced Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KANs)

This project explores the use of Adaptive Basis Functions to improve the representational power of Kolmogorov–Arnold Networks (KANs), a function approximation framework inspired by the Kolmogorov–Arnold representation theorem.

Kolmogorov–Arnold Networks approximate multivariate functions by composing sums of univariate functions. In this project, we introduce Adaptive Basis Functions — smooth, learnable components (e.g., radial basis functions or B-splines) — to replace static or hand-designed basis functions typically used in KANs.
